## The Challenge

To create a scalable backend pipeline that could ingest, process, and extract structured data from unstructured document sources efficiently.

## The Solution

Built a pipeline integrating FastAPI endpoints with Supabase Storage and the OpenAI API. Uploaded documents were parsed, processed, and summarized into structured JSON for analytics or further processing.

## Key Features

- **Document upload and storage** via Supabase
- **FastAPI endpoints** for asynchronous processing
- **OpenAI text extraction** and summarization
- **JSON schema mapping** for downstream apps
- **Early-stage Angular interface** for monitoring tasks

## Technical Approach

- **Backend**: FastAPI async routes and task queue system
- **AI Integration**: GPT-4 model for entity extraction
- **Data Storage**: Supabase tables for job states and results
- **Security**: JWT-protected endpoints with CORS configuration

## Code Highlights

```python
# main.py
@app.post("/process-document/")
async def process_document(file: UploadFile):
    text = extract_text(await file.read())
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Summarize this:\n{text}"}]
    )
    return {"summary": response.choices[0].message.content}
```

*Processes uploaded documents and summarizes them using GPT-4.*

## Results & Impact

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Reduced manual processing time** significantly
- üìÑ **Reliable schema generation** for document metadata
- üöÄ **Prototype used as base** for future enterprise deployment

## Lessons Learned

Combining AI with strict backend architecture taught valuable lessons about prompt stability and rate limits.
