## The Challenge

Creating a personalized digital space for a real wedding that allowed hundreds of guests to RSVP, submit dietary requirements, and view event galleries â€” all while keeping the admin experience simple and intuitive.

## The Solution

A full-stack Angular application with Supabase as the backend, enabling real-time RSVP management and Cloudinary-powered media storage. Guests could register their attendance and dietary info securely, while the couple could manage submissions through an admin dashboard.

## Key Features

- **RSVP form** with secure Supabase insertions
- **Dietary requirement modal** for special meal notes
- **Cloudinary gallery integration** for optimized image loading
- **Real-time guest list updates**
- **Custom admin panel** for viewing and editing guest entries

## Technical Approach

- **Authentication**: Email-based admin login with Supabase Auth
- **Storage**: Cloudinary SDK for file upload, transformations, and CDN delivery
- **UI**: Angular standalone components styled with TailwindCSS
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and route-based prefetching

## Code Highlights

```typescript
// rsvp.service.ts
async submitRSVP(guestId: string, attending: boolean, notes?: string) {
  const { error } = await this.supabase
    .from('guests')
    .update({ attending, notes })
    .eq('id', guestId);

  if (error) throw error;
  return 'RSVP updated successfully';
}
```

*Handles guest RSVPs with Supabase CRUD and real-time updates.*

## Results & Impact

- ðŸŽ¯ **100+ live RSVPs** managed successfully
- ðŸ“· **Optimized gallery** with instant loading
- ðŸ’¡ **Streamlined guest admin workflow** for event planners

## Lessons Learned

Managing a real event with live data introduced edge cases in authentication, data validation, and async workflows â€” improving my understanding of Supabase Realtime and Cloudinary optimization.
